# Go-on-Bert-and-ResNet

* Reconsturct codes in my [old repo](https://github.com/Vincent5201/BERT-for-GO-prediction), but remove redundant parts.
* Train a policy network on ResNet and BERT.
* Implement easy MCTS functoins to predict next move.
* No Reinforce learning.
* For value network, use a computational method instead of deep learning.
* Add pybind11 and use c++ to improve running speed.
